My First Python Project

This is a simple Python program that asks for your age in years and calculates approximately:

The number of months you have lived

The number of days you have lived

The number of hours you have lived


> Note: This calculation assumes 1 year = 365 days.



How to Run

1. Download or clone this repository.


2. Open the file my first python project.py.


3. Run the program:

python "my first python project.py"


4. Enter your age in years when prompted.



Sample Output

Enter your age in years: 20
You have lived approximately:
- 240 months
- 7300 days
- 175200 hours

Changes I Made

Initial upload of the basic program


Future Improvements

Add error handling for invalid or negative input

Allow input as date of birth instead of just age in years

Add calculation for minutes and seconds lived

Handle leap years for more accurate day calculation
